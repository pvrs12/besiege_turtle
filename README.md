#Besiege Turtle Graphics

The idea here is to create a python library which can generate tracks for within Besiege using standard 'turtle' routines (move forward 1, rotate 20, etc).

The basis and inspiriation for this code comes from reddit user [ekbruligas](www.reddit.com/u/ekbruligas) who posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Besiege/comments/3spaus/math_is_awesome_a_parametrically_generated_3d/) in the Beseige subreddit.

The [Besiege](http://www.besiege.spiderlinggames.co.uk/) game is a simple physics based destruction game with surprisingly complex and accurate simulations. Give it a go, it's cheap
